### Database Schema

The project uses a MongoDB database named `shakespeare_db` with a collection called `plays`. Each document in the collection has the following structure:

- **`title`**: (String) The title of the play.
- **`corpus`**: (String) The name of the DraCor corpus (e.g., 'shake').
- **`characters`**: (Array of Objects) A list of characters in the play.
  - **`name`**: (String) The name of the character.
  - **`text`**: (Array of Strings) A list containing all lines of dialogue for that character.
 
### Configuration

This application requires a `secrets.toml` file to store the MongoDB connection URI.

1.  Create a directory named `.streamlit` in the root of the project folder.
2.  Inside the `.streamlit` directory, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
3.  Add the following content to the `secrets.toml` file, replacing the placeholder with your own MongoDB connection string:

    ```toml
    # .streamlit/secrets.toml
    mongo_uri = "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/your_db_name"
    ```
